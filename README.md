# code-obfuscator
Code Obfuscator is a CLI tool that obfuscates or compiles code. It supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, C, C++, and C#. The tool renames identifiers, encodes strings, and minifies output for JavaScript/TypeScript, while compiling other languages into binaries. It auto-detects languages and prompts to install missing dependencies.
